    #In both Java and Flutter, the convention for naming variables, functions, and classes is to use camel case. Camel case is a naming convention where multiple words are concatenated together and the first letter of each subsequent word is capitalized, except for the first word.
    # Lower Camel Case (also known as mixed case or camel case) is used for variable, function 
    #int myVariable;
     #String firstName;
      # void myMethod() {
   # // ..}
#Upper Camel Case (also known as Pascal case or camel case): class
#class MyClass {
    // ...
}
